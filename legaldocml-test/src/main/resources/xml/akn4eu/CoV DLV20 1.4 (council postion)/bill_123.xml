                        financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2011, the
                        Kyrgyz authorities and the IMF agreed on a non-precautionary three-year IMF Extended
                        Credit Facility ("IMF programme") of SDR 66,6 million (Special Drawing Rights) in
                        support of the country. The IMF approved the fourth review of that programme in June
                        2013. The objectives of the IMF programme are consistent with the purpose of the Union
                        macro-financial assistance, namely to alleviate short-term balance of payment
                        difficulties, and the implementation of strong adjustment measures consistent with the

                        assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the
